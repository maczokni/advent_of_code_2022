# Advent of code 2022

Repository for my attempts at advent of code this year. 
Going to try to get past the first week this time. Was thinking about trying Excel again but this first one drove me back to R. We'll see!

Where available excel solutions are in the excel solutions folder. Otherwise R scripts in the scripts folder. 

I tried to comment the best I can, please don't hate on my inefficient looping.
